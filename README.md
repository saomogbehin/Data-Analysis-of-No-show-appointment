Question(s) for Analysis

Under this analysis, the general question is What factors are important for us to know in order to predict if a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment? But in specific term, this analysis will try to analysis the following questions.

Is there any association between patient's gender and show up for their scheduled appointment?
Does age of the patient affect their showing up for the scheduled appointment?
Is scholarship a factor to determine if a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment?


Result

In the analysis we try to provide answers to the following research questions:

Is there any association between patient's gender and show up for their scheduled appointment?
Does age of the patient affect their showing up for the scheduled appointment?
Is scholarship a factor to determine if a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment?
We examine, the relationship among the variables and found out that:

There exist association between patient's gender and noshow.
Analysing patient's age and their response to scheduled appointment, we observe that age is a factor in determining whether a patient will show or not show for an apopintment. As patients of certain age category responded positively to appointment than other.
Scholarship feature could help us in determining if a patient will show up for the visit after an appointment.
However, further analysing is required to establish further causal relationship among the variables. .
